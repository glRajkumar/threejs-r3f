# Three.js Shadows

Shadows in Three.js and React-Three-Fiber enhance realism by simulating how light interacts with objects. Different light sources cast shadows with varying effects and levels of detail.

## Enabling Shadows in Three.js

1. Enable shadows in the renderer:

```javascript
renderer.shadowMap.enabled = true;
```

2. Set `castShadow` to `true` on the light.
3. Set `castShadow` to `true` on objects that should cast shadows.
4. Set `receiveShadow` to `true` on objects that should receive shadows.

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
const cube = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(), new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial());
cube.castShadow = true;
cube.receiveShadow = true;
scene.add(cube);
```


## 1. LightShadow (Base Class)

The `LightShadow` class is the base for all shadow types in Three.js. It is not used directly but inherited by other shadow types.

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
const light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
light.castShadow = true;
scene.add(light);

console.log(light.shadow); // Instance of LightShadow
```


## 2. PointLightShadow

Shadows from a `PointLight` radiate in all directions.

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
const light = new THREE.PointLight(0xffffff, 1, 100);
light.castShadow = true;
scene.add(light);
```

<p className="mb-0">React-Three-Fiber Example</p>

```jsx
<Canvas shadows>
  <pointLight castShadow position={[2, 5, 2]} intensity={1} />
</Canvas>
```

<PointLightShadow />


## 3. DirectionalLightShadow

Shadows from a `DirectionalLight` mimic sunlight and create parallel shadow effects.

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
const light = new THREE.DirectionalLight(0xffffff, 1);
light.position.set(5, 10, 5);
light.castShadow = true;
scene.add(light);
```

<p className="mb-0">React-Three-Fiber Example</p>

```jsx
<Canvas shadows>
  <directionalLight castShadow position={[5, 10, 5]} intensity={1} />
</Canvas>
```

<DirectionalLightShadow />


## 4. SpotLightShadow

Shadows from a `SpotLight` create a focused, conical effect.

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
const light = new THREE.SpotLight(0xffffff, 1);
light.position.set(5, 10, 5);
light.castShadow = true;
scene.add(light);
```

<p className="mb-0">React-Three-Fiber Example</p>

```jsx
<Canvas shadows>
  <spotLight castShadow position={[5, 10, 5]} intensity={1} />
</Canvas>
```

<SpotLightShadow />
