# Advanced Texture Maps in Three.js

## 1. `gradientMap`

* **Used only with:** `MeshToonMaterial`
* Used for toon shading; maps brightness to gradient.
* It's required to set `Texture.minFilter` and `Texture.magFilter` to `THREE.NearestFilter` when using this type of texture.
* Must be a 1D grayscale texture (e.g., 8x1) with nearest filter for toon effect.

### Following maps are only effective with `MeshPhysicalMaterial`

## 2. `anisotropyMap` *(Custom/ShaderMaterial)*

* `Anisotropy` is the property of a material or substance to exhibit different physical properties when measured along different directions. This means that the characteristics of anisotropic materials vary based on the direction of measurement.
* Red and green channels represent the anisotropy direction in [-1, 1] tangent, bitangent space, to be rotated by `.anisotropyRotation`. The blue channel contains strength as [0, 1] to be multiplied by `.anisotropy`.
* Simulates anisotropic surface reflections (like brushed metal).
* **Note:** Not natively supported in built-in materials; requires shader material or extensions like OSL/GLSL or post-processing.
* Requires custom shader setup or extensions like `MeshAnisotropyMaterial` from third-party libs.

## 3. `clearcoatMap`

* `Clear coat` represents the intensity of the clear coat layer, from 0.0 to 1.0 and is to enable multilayer materials that have a thin translucent layer over the base layer.
* The red channel of this texture is multiplied against `.clearcoat`, for per-pixel control over a coating's intensity

---

## 4. `clearcoatNormalMap`

* Can be used to enable independent normals for the clear coat layer

---

## 5. `clearcoatRoughnessMap`

* Roughness of the clear coat layer, from 0.0 to 1.0.
* The green channel of this texture is multiplied against `.clearcoatRoughness`, for per-pixel control over a coating's roughness. 

---

## 6. `iridescenceMap`

* `Iridescence` is the phenomenon of certain surfaces that appear gradually to change colour as the angle of view or the angle of illumination changes
* Controls the presence of iridescence (color shifts like soap bubbles).
* The red channel of this texture is multiplied against `.iridescence`, for per-pixel control over iridescence.

---

## 7. `iridescenceThicknessMap`

* Controls the thickness of the iridescence layer, affecting how colors shift.
* A texture that defines the thickness of the iridescence layer, stored in the green channel.

---

## 8. `sheenRoughnessMap`

* `Sheen` is a soft lustre on a surface.
* The alpha channel of this texture is multiplied against `.sheenRoughness`, for per-pixel control over sheen roughness.

---

## 9. `sheenColorMap`

* The RGB channels of this texture are multiplied against `.sheenColor`, for per-pixel control over sheen tint.

---

## 10. `specularIntensityMap`

* The alpha channel of this texture is multiplied against `.specularIntensity`, for per-pixel control over specular intensity.

---

## 11. `specularColorMap`

* Specifies the RGB color of specular reflections.
* The RGB channels of this texture are multiplied against .specularColor, for per-pixel control over specular color. 

---

## 12. `thicknessMap`

* Controls the thickness of a transparent object, affecting how light refracts.
* A texture that defines the thickness, stored in the green channel.

---

## 13. `transmissionMap`

* Controls areas that allow light to pass through (like glass).
* The red channel of this texture is multiplied against `.transmission`, for per-pixel control over optical transparency.
