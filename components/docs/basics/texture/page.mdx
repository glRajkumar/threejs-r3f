# Textures in Three.js

Textures allow you to add rich detail to the surface of your 3D objects by mapping 2-dimensional images (or other data) onto their geometry. Instead of relying purely on vertex colors or materials, a texture can describe color, surface irregularities, light emission, transparency, and much more. This page covers the essentials of working with textures in both **Three.js** and **React-Three-Fiber (R3F)**, following the same structure as our *Geometries* guide.

A texture is essentially a bitmap—PNG, JPEG, WebP, video frame, or even procedurally-generated data—that is sampled in the fragment shader to influence the final pixel color. In Three.js, every texture is an instance of `THREE.Texture` or one of its subclasses.

## Loading a Texture

<p className="mb-0">Three.js Example</p>

```javascript
import * as THREE from "three";

const loader = new THREE.TextureLoader();
loader.load("/textures/brick_diffuse.jpg", (texture) => {
  const material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({ map: texture });
  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(new THREE.BoxGeometry(2, 2, 2), material);
  scene.add(mesh);
});
```

<p className="mb-0">React-Three-Fiber Example</p>

```jsx
import { useTexture } from "@react-three/drei";

function Boxes() {
  const texture = useTexture("/textures/brick_diffuse.jpg");
  return (
    <mesh>
      <boxGeometry args={[2, 2, 2]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial map={texture} />
    </mesh>
  );
}
```
